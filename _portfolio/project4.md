In 2020 we added [another edX course](https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer) for the Linux Foundation, this time targeting developers. We refreshed the course in 2021. For many developers that are building verifiable credential-based applications, this is the first stop on their journey.

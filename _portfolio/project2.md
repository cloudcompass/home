We've been contributing to Hyperledger Indy since 2017, including helping with the splitting of Indy into its
component parts -- the ledger (Indy Node and Indy VDR client), credential exchange using AnonCreds, and
secure storage of DIDs, verifiable credentials and more (Aries Askar). We've also played a big role
in the ["did:indy" DID Method specification](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/).

Hyperledger Aries is a shared, reusable, interoperable set of protocols and open source implementations for creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. Cloud Compass Computing was an organizer of the Hyperledger conferences at which Aries was first imagined (the series of "Connect-a-thon" interoperability conferences in Utah),
and has been a contributor and maintainer of the [Aries RFCs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs) -- the protocols that enable Aries interoperability.
